# Wrangle-and-Analyze-Data-WeRateDogs-Project
Real-world data rarely comes clean. Using Python and its libraries, I gathered data from a variety of sources and in a variety of formats, assessed its quality and tidiness, then cleaned it. This is called data wrangling. I have also documented my wrangling efforts in a Jupyter Notebook, as well as demonstrated them through analyses and visualizations using Python (and its libraries).
